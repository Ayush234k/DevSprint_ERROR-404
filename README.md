Sustainability-

Hostel Mess cook tons of food every single day, by taking a rough estimate of how much students eat. This leads to a lot of wastage of food. We are solving this problem by making a website in which students who don't want to attend lunch can notify the mess management before hand and those who do will get a refund amount for the meal they skipped.
